		<p> This game is a snake that moves around and gets longer as you eat food. This game is called Snake and uses the arrow keys to move, 'q' to quit, 'r' to restart and 'd' to debug or show the list board in action. The goal of this game is to collect the blue circles, food, and get the snake as long as you can without running tinto your own tail or running into the walls of the board.</p>

		<p>Overall, this project was very successful, it did what I wanted it to do, and it works fairly smooth. If I were to remake it, I would want to figure out a way that could make turns not affect the speed of the snake like it does in my game to avoid problems. Throughout the project I wasn't sure if I would be able to get it working, but after all my attempt, it worked as I wanted it to. When I first got the snake to move, it made me so happy! Throughout this project, I felt accomplished for being able to make this awesome game.</p>

		<p><font color = "purple">Explanation:</font>This screenshot is showing an action shot from the beginning of the game; the user has 'eaten' two food and is now 3 units long. </p>

		<p><font color = "purple">Explanation:</font>This second screenshot is showing the debugging in action and after a while in the game where the snake is longer and more accomplished :)</p>
		<p><font color="purple" size="5">A snippet of code:</font></p>
		<p>if ((newHeadRow < 0) or (newHeadRow >= rows) or</p>
        <p>(newHeadCol < 0) or (newHeadCol >= cols)): </p>
        <p>gameOver(canvas)</p>
		<p><font color = "purple">Explanation:</font>This section of code was pretty tough to figure out, as it was figuring out how to make the game end when the snake hits itself. This code is basically describing that if the integer of where the snake is moving to is above one (all snake parts are above one) that it will end the game.</p>
